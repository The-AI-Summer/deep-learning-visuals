# Deep Learning visuals


A collection of Deep Learning images and visualizations. The project has been developed by the [AI Summer](https://theaisummer.com/) team and currently contains almost **100 images**.  


- Articles for the [AI Summer](https://theaisummer.com/) blog
- [Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks](https://www.educative.io/courses/intro-deep-learning) course in educative.io

This repository was inspired by:

- [ml-visuals](https://github.com/dair-ai/ml-visuals) repository maintained by [dair.ai](https://dair.ai/)
- [dl-visuals](https://github.com/dvgodoy/dl-visuals) repository maintained by [Daniel Voigt Godoy](https://github.com/dvgodoy)

The images have been created using [https://www.diagrams.net/](https://www.diagrams.net/) over the past years.

## Can I use them?

Of course. You are allowed to use the images anywhere you like ( even for commercial use), as long as you attribute AI Summer.
