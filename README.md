# Deep Learning visuals

Shield: [![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]


A collection 100 Deep Learning images and visulaizations. 

The images have been created using [https://www.diagrams.net/](https://www.diagrams.net/) over the past years and have been included in:

- Articles for the [AI Summer](https://theaisummer.com/) blog
- [Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks](https://www.educative.io/courses/intro-deep-learning) course in educative.io
- Upcoming Deep Learning in Production bool
- Upcoming Introduction to Deep Learning book

## Can  I use them?

Of course. You are allowed to use the images anywhere you like ( even for commercial use), as long as you attribute AI Summer.
